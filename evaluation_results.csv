How does Retrieval-Augmented Generation work?,"['Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in LLM-Powered Question-Answering Pipelines', ""An example of why this agentic behavior can be so powerful can be found when considering a typical retrieval augmented generation (RAG) application. In a typical RAG application, a call to a retriever is made that returns some documents. These documents are then passed to an LLM to generate a final answer. While this is often effective, it breaks down in cases when the first retrieval step fails to return any useful results. In this case, it's often ideal if the LLM can reason that the results returned from the retriever are poor, and maybe issue a second (more refined) query to the retriever, and use those results instead. Essentially, running an LLM in a loop helps create applications that are more flexible and thus can accomplish more vague use-cases that may not be predefined.\n\nThese types of applications are often called agents.

When evaluating a QA pipeline you have to evaluate both of these separately and together to get an overall score as well as the individual scores to pinpoint the aspects you want to improve. For example, using a better chunking strategy or embedding model can improve the retriever while using a different model or prompt can bring about changes to the generation step. You might want to measure the tendency for hallucinations in the generation step or the recall for the retrieval step.']","Based on the provided context, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) works by combining two main steps in a loop:

1. **Retriever**: This step retrieves relevant documents or information from a dataset or database in response to a query. If the initial retrieval step fails to return useful results, the LLM can reason that the results are poor and issue a second, more refined query to the retriever.

2. **Generator**: This step, typically powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), generates a final answer based on the retrieved information. In cases where the initial retrieval step fails, the LLM can attempt to refine its query and improve the results.

The loop is created by running the LLM in a continuous cycle, allowing it to refine its query and improve the results based on the retrieved information. This approach enables the creation of more flexible and effective applications that can accomplish vague use-cases that may not be predefined.

To evaluate the performance of a RAG pipeline, it's essential to assess both the retriever and generator separately, as well as their combined performance, to identify areas for improvement and optimize the pipeline accordingly.",0.4444444444444444,

Specifically, the embedding model is used to convert the query, as well as the texts in the database, into vector embeddings. These vector embeddings are then compared to find relevant vectors, which correspond to the most relevant texts in the database.

In more detail, the embedding model is used for the following purposes:

1. **Query embedding**: The embedding model is used to convert the user's query into a vector representation, which is then compared to the vector embeddings of the texts in the database.
2. **Text embedding**: The embedding model is used to convert each text in the database into a vector representation, which is then stored in the database along with the corresponding text.
3. **Vector comparison**: The vector embeddings of the query and the texts in the database are compared to find the most relevant vectors, which correspond to the most relevant texts.

By using an embedding model to convert the query and the texts into vector representations, RAG systems can efficiently perform semantic search over a large database of texts, and retrieve the most relevant information to support the user's question.

In the context of Ragas, LangSmith's evaluation features are used to analyze the results of the RAG system, including the performance of the embedding model in retrieving relevant information.",0.6153846153846154,

To answer the question, I'll take a step back and consider the context of LLMs in general. Hallucinations in LLMs refer to the phenomenon where the model generates information that is not supported by the input data. This can lead to inaccurate or false information being presented as fact.

Given the discussion on RAG applications and agents, it's likely that the importance of reducing hallucinations is related to the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs in these applications.

Reducing hallucinations is important for LLMs because it ensures the reliability and accuracy of the information they generate.

1. A customer visits the company's website and initiates a chat with the bot.
2. The customer types in a question, such as ""What are the system requirements for the new X500 laptop model?""
3. The RAG system uses semantic search to retrieve relevant information from a database of product documentation, FAQs, and knowledge base articles related to the X500 laptop model.

* The chatbot can retrieve proprietary or private company data, such as product documentation and technical specifications, which may not be publicly available.
