Note: As of October 2025, LangGraph Platform has been re-named to "LangSmith Deployment".

Today, we’re excited to announce that LangSmith and LangGraph Platform are available in the new AI Agents and Tools category of AWS Marketplace. 

Customers can now use AWS Marketplace to easily discover, buy, and deploy LangSmith and LangGraph Platform using their AWS accounts, accelerating agent and agentic workflow development.

LangSmith and LangGraph Platform are already trusted by leading engineering teams to bring reliability, visibility, and control to complex agentic workflows. As Nicholas Larus-Stone, Software Engineer at Benchling, puts it:

“LangSmith gives us full visibility into our LLM workflows – without compromising on data privacy or control.” 
With this Marketplace availability, teams can now run LangChain’s commercial offerings entirely within their AWS VPCs via Helm charts— while benefiting from centralized purchasing, security assurance, and seamless integration with their Amazon EKS clusters.

Benefits of LangSmith
LangSmith provides enterprise teams with a unified platform to debug, test, and monitor AI app performance. Its core capabilities span prompt engineering, evaluation, and observability: 

Prompt Engineering

LangSmith enables structured, collaborative prompt development. The Prompt Hub allows users to version, manage, and share prompts across teams, while the Prompt Playground allows for rapid testing and comparison of different models before deployment. These tools help engineering and domain experts iterate quickly together and ensure consistency across use cases.

Evals

LangSmith makes it easy to evaluate application performance with both pre-deployment testing as well as continuous feedback on production traffic. Teams can run experiments to compare prompt or model changes, collect human feedback through annotation queues, and organize reusable datasets to track performance over time. This helps teams catch regressions, quantify quality, and ship with more confidence. 

Observability

LangSmith offers deep visibility into application behavior with detailed tracing and real-time monitoring. Engineering teams can inspect and debug individual interactions, configure alerts on key metrics, and track trends over time. This observability layer helps enterprise teams maintain quality, auditability, and explainability for agent behavior. 

Benefits of LangGraph Platform
LangGraph Platform provides the infrastructure needed to deploy, scale, and manage stateful, long-running agents. It allows teams to:

Deploy agents with ease

LangGraph Platform is designed for long-running agent workloads, handling bursty traffic, persistent state, and asynchronous collaboration out of the box. Teams can deploy in minutes with 1-click GitHub integration and choose from SaaS, hybrid, or fully self-hosted options to fit compliance needs. 

Accelerate agent development with visual workflows

Building great agents requires fast feedback loops. LangGraph Studio— the built-in agent IDE in LangGraph Platform — lets developers visualize, debug, and test agent workflows in real time. Instead of retrying things from scratch, built-in checkpointing and memory modules in LangGraph Platform make it easy to rewind, edit, and rerun failure points without frustration.

Centralize agent management across the organizationAs agent adoption grows across teams, LangGraph Platform gives organizations a unified way to manage every agent. The agent registry lets users discover available agents in the organization, and common agent architectures can be reused with “assistants” in LangGraph Platform. 

Why procure LangSmith and LangGraph Platform via AWS Marketplace
With the availability of AI Agents and Tools in AWS Marketplace, customers can significantly accelerate their procurement process to drive AI innovation, reducing the time needed for vendor evaluations and complex negotiations. With centralized purchasing using AWS accounts, customers maintain visibility and control over licensing, payments, and access through AWS.

LangSmith and LangGraph Platform are available as self-hosted deployments via Helm charts, enabling you to run both platforms entirely within your AWS VPC on Amazon EKS. No data is shared with third-party services, ensuring strong security, data privacy, and compliance with internal governance standards.
